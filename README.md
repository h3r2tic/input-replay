# ðŸ–± `input-replay`

Records and replays input with precise timing. Only mouse movements and left & right clicks right now.

- `Win+F2` to start recording, then again to stop.
- `Win+F3` to replay the recording.

## Platforms

Windows only. Could probably do Linux [based on this](https://github.com/h3r2tic/h3keys3/tree/linux-wip).
